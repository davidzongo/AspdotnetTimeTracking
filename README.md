# AspdotnetTimeTracking
THis is the release version of my AspdotnetTimetracking application.
Asp.net MVC
Responsive bootstrap
The demo can be view at http://aspdotnettimetracking.com/
The article about this app can be found at http://davidzongo.com/?p=87

Installation:
Download the 2 files Aspdotnettimetracking1 and ContentToBeIncludeInsideFolderAspdotnettimetracking
Copy ContentToBeIncludeInsideFolderAspdotnettimetracking inside the first with folder name Content. Check the image include to understand folder structure. This is straightforward but in case u are confused
